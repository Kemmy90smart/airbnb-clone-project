Airbnb Clone Project â€“ StayBackend Assignment
##Project Overview

This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, designed as part of the StayBackend assignment.
The goal is to simulate the backend infrastructure of a vacation rental platform, providing APIs for users, hosts, bookings, and listings, while ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability.

The system focuses on:

Listing and booking properties

User and host management

Authentication and authorization

Robust database design

CI/CD pipeline for automation

##Team Roles (Task 1)

Each member plays a critical role in building and maintaining the project:

Project Manager â€“ Oversees progress, ensures deadlines are met

Backend Developers â€“ Implement APIs, database design, and business logic

DevOps Engineer â€“ Handles deployment, CI/CD pipelines, server management

QA Engineer â€“ Tests API endpoints, validates system performance and security

Technical Writer â€“ Documents API, writes README, and project guidelines

##Technology Stack (Task 2)

The project is built using the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: Python (Django / Flask) OR Node.js (Express.js)

Database: PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) + OAuth2

Cloud Hosting: AWS / Heroku / Render

CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions / Docker

API Documentation: Swagger / Postman

##Database Design (Task 3)

Users (1) ---- (M) Bookings  
Listings (1) ---- (M) Bookings  
Bookings (1) ---- (1) Payments  

##Features & Functionality (Task 4)

User Management: Sign up, login, profile updates

Listing Management: Hosts can create, update, delete listings

Search & Filter: Guests can search listings by location, date, price

Booking System: Guests can book listings and check availability

Payments: Secure integration with payment gateway (Stripe/Paystack)

Reviews: Guests can leave reviews for hosts/listings

Admin Panel: Manage users, bookings, and disputes

##API Security (Task 5)

Security measures to protect user data and platform integrity:

Authentication: JWT-based authentication for API requests

Authorization: Role-based access (guest, host, admin)

Input Validation: Prevent SQL injection & XSS attacks

Rate Limiting: Throttling API calls to prevent abuse

Data Encryption: Secure storage of sensitive info (hashed passwords, SSL/TLS for requests)

##CI/CD Pipeline (Task 6)

Steps for continuous integration and deployment:

Version Control â€“ GitHub repository for collaboration

Automated Testing â€“ Unit tests run on each pull request

Build Process â€“ Docker containers for consistent deployment

Continuous Integration â€“ GitHub Actions ensures code is tested automatically

Continuous Deployment â€“ Successful builds auto-deployed to cloud (Heroku/AWS)

Monitoring â€“ Logs & error tracking with tools like Sentry / Datadog
