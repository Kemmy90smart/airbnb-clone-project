- **Collaboration:** Developers, designers, and testers can easily communicate using shared design values.  
- **Efficiency:** Speeds up the development process by reusing consistent design tokens.  
- **Scalability:** When updates occur (e.g., a new color scheme), changes can be applied globally without breaking the layout.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensures proper contrast, readability, and usability across all devices.  

Understanding these design properties helps bridge the gap between **design and development**, ensuring the mockup in Figma is accurately translated into real, functional code.
